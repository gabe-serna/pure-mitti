## Overview

This document contains everything that you need to know in order to use the Pure Mitti Fulfillment Spreadsheet.

In this section, we will discuss the high level purpose of every tab in this spreadsheet. In later sections, more in-depth explanations and tutorials will be provided for the main use cases for this tool. At the end, we'll go over all of the supplementary functions provided in the menu.

<br>

### What are the main uses of this spreadsheet?

1. Fulfill Orders

Whether it be sending out a small sample or logging the tracking information for a huge wholesale order, the **main purpose** of this spreadsheet is to assist you with fulfilling orders for Pure Mitti.

2. Check the Shipping Status of an Order

Every once in awhile, you should check the status of all the orders we have shipped out recently. This will allow us to ensure that shipping is going smoothly, or catch any issues early if there are any. More on how to do this in the [Shipments](#shipments) section.

3. Update Inventory Stock

It is incredibly important to Pure Mitti that we maintain an accurate record of our inventory at all times. This means updating the inventory when a new shipment arrives, and doing regular inventory recounts. More on how to do this in the [Inventory](#inventory) section.

4. Analysis

The Shipment Log tab is a record of all the shipments we have sent out starting in 2024. The benefit of having so much data on our shipments stored all in one place is that doing analysis is vastly easier. Using this data, we have created some charts in the Metrics tab to better understand the relationship between different metrics.

</p>

The Shipments tab is a very powerful tool we use for sending out shipments and for checking on shipping status. Generally, you want to treat this tab as mostly _view-only_ with the exception of the **Notes** column and the **Items** column. Otherwise, you will interact with this page using the tools provided to you in the [Menu](#menu-items-reference).

<br>

### Shipments Overview

The Shipments Tab can be divided into 2 sections:

1. Incoming Orders
2. Outgoing Shipments

Orders that come from <span style="color:forestgreen">**Shopify**</span>, <span style="color:grey">**Faire**</span>, and <span style="color:mediumpurple">**PodFoods**</span> will automatically be populated in the Incoming Orders section, and likewise will move to the Outgoing Shipments tab once shipped. <span style="color:darkorange">**Etsy**</span> has not yet been integrated.

**All other orders you must add and update manually.**

> _Note: Faire orders must be accepted before they will show up in the Incoming Orders section._

<br>
Once an order is detected as being delivered, it will automatically clear from the Shipments tab and will go to the Shipment Log where additional data about the shipment will be logged.

<br>

### How to Use It

</p>

<p align="center">
 <em>Fig 2. An example image of the Incoming Orders section</em>
</p>

The first thing you want to do when fulfilling orders is to check the **Incoming Orders** section. This will give you an overview of what orders you need to fulfill. <span style="color:darkorange">**Etsy**</span> orders will not appear here. **You must still manually check Faire for orders not yet accepted.**

> For these orders, add notes regarding any extras that were sent _(flyers, shelf toppers, sample soaps, etc.)_, and adjust the Items Ordered column if needed _(item changes, errors with the script, etc.)_.

As stated previously, these orders will automatically be moved to the Outgoing Shipments section and then to the Shipment Log.

---

<br>

Once you have fulfilled all of the orders that come from these portals, you may still have **manual orders** to fulfill. In order to add and and update these orders, you must utilize some of the [Menu Item](#menu-items-reference) functions.

> _Note: Manual Orders in this context will be defined as orders that are not inputted through a system, but rather asked for directly in-person on through email._

‚ûï **Manually Add New Order**
- Use this to add a manual order to the Incoming Orders section.

<br>

‚Ü™Ô∏è **Move Manual Order to Shipment**

- Once a manual order has been shipped out, use this to move the order to the Outgoing Shipments section.

<br>

‚ûï **Manually Add Shipment to Log**

- If a manual order was shipped out before it was added to the incoming orders section, use this to add it to the Outgoing Shipments section.
  <br>
  <br>

### Shipment Statuses & Tracking

Sometimes, you will use the Shipment tab to check the shipping status of the orders you have recently sent out. Here are the common shipment statuses you will find and what you should do about them.

<span style="color:dodgerblue">PRE_TRANSIT</span> or <span style="color:darkgrey">UNKNOWN</span> or <span style="color:darkgrey">CONFIRMED</span> or <span style="color:gray">not found</span>

- The package has not yet been scanned by the carrier.
- This usually changes within a day or two at most. If a shipment has this status for a few days and has been given to the carrier, copy the tracking number and check the status on the carrier website for more detailed information.
  > Even if a package was not scanned at its drop-off location, it still may be scanned at a later date as it travels and can still be delivered.

<span style="color:gold">TRANSIT</span>

- The package is en route to the customer.
- This is the most common tracking status you will see. Once a package has been scanned by the carrier its status will change to this up until when it gets delivered.
- Once a shipment has this status, an **ETA** may be added at the bottom of its notes if it's available. If it is a few days past the ETA date, copy the tracking number and check the status on the carrier website for more detailed information. The shipment might be delayed or sometimes even lost.

<span style="color:green">**DELIVERED**</span>

- The package has successfully been delivered to the customer.
- Most of the time you won't see this status because the spreadsheet will check every hour for shipments of this status and move it to the Shipment Log tab. In the case that you do see this status, just give it some time and it will automatically go away.

<br>

---

<br>
Now here are some of the less common statuses and what they mean.

<br>

<span style="color:darkgrey">OUT_FOR_DELIVERY</span>

- The package is out for delivery.
- This will most likely go away within a day and will be replaced with <span style="color:green">**DELIVERED**</span> but may sometimes be replaced with <span style="color:darkgray">DELIVERY_ATTEMPTED</span>.

<span style="color:darkgray">DELIVERY_ATTEMPTED</span>

- The package had an unsuccessful delivery attempt and will make another attempt soon.
- This will likely go away within a few days once a successful delivery attempt is made. If this status remains, copy the tracking number and check the status on the carrier website for more detailed information.

<br>

## Shipment Tracker Script

[API Calls & Get New Orders](#api-calls--get-new-orders) - [Check If Shipped](#check-if-shipped) - [Check If Transit](#check-if-transit) - [Check If Delivered](#check-if-delivered)

Even if you aren't going to be interacting with the source code, it would still be beneficial to understand at a high level what is going on "behind the scenes".

Major Sections:

- API Calls
- Get New Orders
- Check If Shipped
- Check If Transit
- Check if Delivered

<br>

**üìåEach major section of the script is scheduled to run once every hour.üìå**

### API Calls & Get New Orders

The first part of this script starts with making **API Calls** to the apps we use to retrieve all of our order data. This part is the most important because without this data there would be nothing to display in the spreadsheet.

> _Think of an API like a waiter at a restaurant. You give the waiter your order, the waiter gives your order to the kitchen, and then once its done your waiter comes back with your order. It's the same process with an API. You give the API your request (in this case we want data about our orders), the API gives that request to Shopify/PodFoods/Etsy's backend where that data is stored, and then the API gives us whatever the backend returns._

All of the API logic is stored in **Api Calls.gs** _(not uploaded to this repo for security reasons)_. The data retrieved from these calls are stored in separate sheets that are hidden by default. You actually find these sheets by clicking the "All Sheets" in the bottom left corner of the spreadsheet.

<br>

For <span style="color:forestgreen">**Shopify**</span> and <span style="color:mediumpurple">**PodFoods**</span>, we split up the data that we retrieve from the API calls into two categories:

- **New Orders**: Still need to be fulfilled and will show up in the Incoming Orders section.

- **Shipped Orders**: Shipping label purchased and will show up in the Outgoing Shipments section.

> <span style="color:grey">**Faire**</span> orders are currently tracked through the <span style="color:forestgreen">**Shopify**</span> API.

Once we have all of the data stored in the spreadsheet, the next main function that runs is **Get New Orders**. All it does is add new orders to the Incoming Orders section if they aren't already there. Any of the functions regarding API calls or getting new orders can be run manually using one of the [Menu Item](#menu-items-reference) functions.

### Check If Shipped

Now that all of the new orders have been added, the next part of the script is **Check If Shipped**.

As the name suggests, this part of the script checks all of the orders in the Incoming Orders section and checks if they have been shipped. The way it does this is by getting the order ID of the new order and searching for it in the list of shipped orders. If there is a match, then the order has been shipped and must be updated. If there is no match then it has not been shipped yet.

> If you want to manually run this part of the script you can use the following Menu Item function: üöö **Update All Outgoing Shipments**

<br>

### Check If Transit

Once an item has been shipped out, we can run the **Check If Transit** part of the script to update the ETA for all orders in the Outgoing Shipments section.

The ETA will be appended to the bottom of each order's notes. If any updates are made to the ETA as the package is being shipped, the ETA in the spreadsheet will update accordingly. Until the carrier provides an ETA, the notes will remain unchanged.

‚ö†Ô∏è On occassion the ETA might display <span style="color:grey">**"DELAYED"**</span>, in which case you should copy the tracking number and check the status on the carrier website for more detailed information.

> If you want to manually run this part of the script you can use the following Menu Item function: ‚è∞ **Update ETA**

<br>

### Check If Delivered

As packages finally reach the customer, the final part of the script that cleans everything up is **Check If Delivered**.

This part of the script runs by checking the status of all orders in the Outgoing Shipments section. Any orders that have a status of <span style="color:green">**DELIVERED**</span> will be removed from the Shipments tab and added to the Shipment Log tab. Inside the Shipment Log, you can see the history of all orders we have sent out since **2024** along with additional data such as Order Number, Order Value, Shipping Cost, Address, and more.

> If you want to manually run this part of the script you can use the following Menu Item function: üì¶ **Update All Delivered Shipments**
