## Overview

This document contains everything that you need to know in order to use the Pure Mitti Fulfillment Spreadsheet.

In this section, we will discuss the high level purpose of every tab in this spreadsheet. In later sections, more in-depth explanations and tutorials will be provided for the main use cases for this tool. At the end, we'll go over all of the supplementary functions provided in the menu.

### What are the main uses of this spreadsheet?

1. Fulfill Orders

Whether it be sending out a small sample or logging the tracking information for a huge wholesale order, the **main purpose** of this spreadsheet is to assist you with fulfilling orders for Pure Mitti.

2. Check the Shipping Status of an Order

Every once in awhile, you should check the status of all the orders we have shipped out recently. This will allow us to ensure that shipping is going smoothly, or catch any issues early if there are any. More on how to do this in the [Shipments](#shipments) section.

3. Update Inventory Stock

It is incredibly important to Pure Mitti that we maintain an accurate record of our inventory at all times. This means updating the inventory when a new shipment arrives, and doing regular inventory recounts. More on how to do this in the [Inventory](#inventory) section.

4. Analysis

The Shipment Log tab is a record of all the shipments we have sent out starting in 2024. The benefit of having so much data on our shipments stored all in one place is that doing analysis is vastly easier. Using this data, we have created some charts in the Metrics tab to better understand the relationship between different metrics.
